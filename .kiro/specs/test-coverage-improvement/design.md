# Design Document: Test Coverage Improvement

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for improving the test coverage of the Phaser MCP Server from the current ~24% to at least 90%. The strategy focuses on systematically addressing each module with targeted test cases, prioritizing critical functionality, and implementing both unit and integration tests. The design also includes considerations for test infrastructure, mocking strategies, and continuous integration.

## Architecture

The test architecture will follow the existing project structure, with test files corresponding to each source file. The architecture consists of:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual functions and classes in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Testing complete workflows through the MCP interface
4. **Coverage Reporting**: Generating and analyzing test coverage metrics

The test architecture will use pytest as the testing framework, with pytest-asyncio for asynchronous tests, pytest-mock for mocking, and pytest-cov for coverage reporting.

## Components and Interfaces

2. **File System**
   - Use `pytest-mock` to mock file operations
   - Create temporary test directories when needed

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Use `monkeypatch` to set environment variables for testing

4. **MCP Context**
   - Create a mock MCP context for testing tool functions

## Data Models

### Test Data Models

1. **HTML Fixtures**
   - Sample HTML files for different Phaser documentation pages
   - Malformed HTML for testing error handling
   - HTML with security concerns for testing validation

2. **Expected Markdown Results**
   - Expected Markdown output for testing conversion

3. **Mock HTTP Responses**
   - Success responses with different status codes
   - Error responses with different status codes
   - Responses with rate limiting headers

4. **Test Configuration**
   - Test parameters for different test scenarios
   - Coverage thresholds for different modules

## Error Handling

The test suite will include specific tests for error handling scenarios:

1. **Network Errors**
   - Connection errors
   - Timeouts
   - DNS resolution failures

2. **HTTP Errors**
   - 4xx client errors
   - 5xx server errors
   - Malformed responses

3. **Parsing Errors**
   - Malformed HTML
   - Invalid Markdown
   - Security validation failures

4. **Validation Errors**
   - Invalid URLs
   - Invalid data models
   - Security validation failures

## Testing Strategy

### Coverage Improvement Strategy

1. **Baseline Analysis**
   - Analyze current coverage reports to identify untested code
   - Prioritize critical functionality and error paths

2. **Incremental Approach**
   - Start with models module (highest current coverage)
   - Move to parser module (medium complexity)
   - Address client module (high complexity, many edge cases)
   - Finally, address server module (depends on other modules)

3. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write tests before implementing missing functionality
   - Use tests to validate bug fixes and improvements

### Test Categories

1. **Functional Tests**
   - Test that functions and methods work as expected
   - Test with valid inputs and expected outputs

2. **Edge Case Tests**
   - Test with boundary values
   - Test with empty or minimal inputs
   - Test with large or complex inputs

3. **Error Case Tests**
   - Test with invalid inputs
   - Test error handling and recovery
   - Test exception propagation

4. **Security Tests**
   - Test URL validation
   - Test HTML sanitization
   - Test input validation

### Continuous Integration

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Run tests on every pull request and merge to main
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Fail if coverage is below threshold

2. **Coverage Reporting**
   - Generate HTML and XML coverage reports
   - Publish reports as artifacts
   - Track coverage trends over time

### Test Implementation Patterns

#### Unit Test Pattern

```python
def test_function_name_scenario():
    # Arrange
    input_data = ...
    expected_output = ...
    
    # Act
    actual_output = function_name(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert actual_output == expected_output
```

#### Async Test Pattern

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_function_name_scenario():
    # Arrange
    input_data = ...
    expected_output = ...
    
    # Act
    actual_output = await async_function_name(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert actual_output == expected_output
```

#### Mock Test Pattern

```python
def test_function_with_dependencies(mocker):
    # Arrange
    mock_dependency = mocker.patch('module.dependency')
    mock_dependency.return_value = expected_dependency_output
    input_data = ...
    expected_output = ...
    
    # Act
    actual_output = function_with_dependency(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert actual_output == expected_output
    mock_dependency.assert_called_once_with(input_data)
```

### Coverage Configuration

```ini
[coverage:run]
source = phaser_mcp_server
omit = 
    */tests/*
    */__pycache__/*
    */__init__.py

[coverage:report]
exclude_lines =
    pragma: no cover
    def __repr__
    raise NotImplementedError
    if __name__ == .__main__.:
    pass
    raise ImportError
```

## Technical Considerations

### Asynchronous Testing

The Phaser MCP Server uses asynchronous code extensively, requiring special testing approaches:

1. **pytest-asyncio**
   - Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator for async tests
   - Use `asyncio.run()` for running async code in synchronous tests

2. **Mock Async Functions**
   - Use `AsyncMock` for mocking async functions
   - Handle coroutines properly in test assertions

### Test Isolation

To ensure test isolation and prevent side effects:

1. **Fixtures**
   - Use pytest fixtures for setup and teardown
   - Use function-scoped fixtures for maximum isolation
   - Use module or session-scoped fixtures for expensive resources

2. **Mocking**
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Reset mocks between tests
   - Use context managers for temporary changes

### Performance Considerations

To keep the test suite fast and efficient:

1. **Parallelization**
   - Use pytest-xdist for parallel test execution
   - Group tests to minimize fixture setup/teardown overhead

2. **Selective Testing**
   - Allow running specific test categories
   - Skip slow tests in quick runs

3. **Mocking vs. Real Dependencies**
   - Mock network calls and file system operations
   - Use in-memory databases for data storage tests

## Security Considerations

The test suite will include specific tests for security concerns:

1. **URL Validation**
   - Test that only allowed domains are accepted
   - Test that malicious URL schemes are rejected
   - Test that path traversal attempts are detected

2. **HTML Sanitization**
   - Test that script tags are handled safely
   - Test that event handlers are removed
   - Test that malicious attributes are sanitized

3. **Input Validation**
   - Test that user inputs are properly validated
   - Test that injection attempts are detected
   - Test that large inputs are handled safely

## Conclusion

This design provides a comprehensive approach to improving the test coverage of the Phaser MCP Server. By systematically addressing each module with targeted test cases, the coverage can be increased from the current ~24% to at least 90%. The design includes considerations for test infrastructure, mocking strategies, and continuous integration to ensure the reliability and stability of the Phaser MCP Server.
