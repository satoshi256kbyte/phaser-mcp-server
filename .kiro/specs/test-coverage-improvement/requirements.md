# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Phaser MCP Server currently has a test coverage of approximately 24%, which is significantly below the target of 90%. This feature aims to improve the test coverage by adding comprehensive tests for untested or partially tested components, focusing on the most critical areas first. The goal is to ensure the reliability and stability of the Phaser MCP Server by validating its functionality through automated tests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to increase the test coverage of the parser module to at least 90%, so that I can ensure its reliability and catch potential bugs early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running test coverage on the parser module THEN the coverage percentage SHALL be at least 90%.
2. WHEN adding new tests for the parser module THEN they SHALL cover edge cases and error handling scenarios.
3. WHEN implementing parser tests THEN they SHALL validate both successful parsing and error conditions.
4. WHEN testing the parser module THEN all public methods SHALL have corresponding test cases.
5. WHEN testing the parser module THEN tests SHALL validate the correct handling of malformed HTML, large content, and security concerns.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to increase the test coverage of the client module to at least 90%, so that I can ensure its reliability and catch potential bugs early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running test coverage on the client module THEN the coverage percentage SHALL be at least 90%.
2. WHEN adding new tests for the client module THEN they SHALL cover network error handling, retry logic, and security validations.
3. WHEN implementing client tests THEN they SHALL validate both successful API calls and error conditions.
4. WHEN testing the client module THEN all public methods SHALL have corresponding test cases.
5. WHEN testing the client module THEN tests SHALL validate the correct handling of rate limiting, timeouts, and server errors.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to increase the test coverage of the server module to at least 90%, so that I can ensure its reliability and catch potential bugs early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running test coverage on the server module THEN the coverage percentage SHALL be at least 90%.
2. WHEN adding new tests for the server module THEN they SHALL cover MCP tool functions and error handling.
3. WHEN implementing server tests THEN they SHALL validate both successful tool execution and error conditions.
4. WHEN testing the server module THEN all public methods and MCP tools SHALL have corresponding test cases.
5. WHEN testing the server module THEN tests SHALL validate the correct handling of initialization, cleanup, and command-line arguments.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to increase the test coverage of the models module to at least 90%, so that I can ensure its reliability and catch potential bugs early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running test coverage on the models module THEN the coverage percentage SHALL be at least 90%.
2. WHEN adding new tests for the models module THEN they SHALL cover validation logic and edge cases.
3. WHEN implementing models tests THEN they SHALL validate both valid and invalid data scenarios.
4. WHEN testing the models module THEN all model classes and validators SHALL have corresponding test cases.
5. WHEN testing the models module THEN tests SHALL validate the correct handling of serialization, deserialization, and validation errors.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement integration tests that validate the end-to-end functionality of the Phaser MCP Server, so that I can ensure all components work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN they SHALL validate the end-to-end functionality of the Phaser MCP Server.
2. WHEN implementing integration tests THEN they SHALL cover the main user workflows.
3. WHEN testing integration scenarios THEN tests SHALL validate the correct interaction between client, parser, and server components.
4. WHEN running integration tests THEN they SHALL use mock HTTP responses to simulate Phaser documentation website.
5. WHEN implementing integration tests THEN they SHALL validate the correct handling of MCP tool invocations.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a continuous integration workflow that runs tests and reports coverage, so that I can monitor test coverage over time and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the CI workflow THEN it SHALL execute all tests and generate a coverage report.
2. WHEN the CI workflow completes THEN it SHALL fail if the coverage is below the target threshold.
3. WHEN implementing the CI workflow THEN it SHALL run on every pull request and merge to main branch.
4. WHEN the CI workflow runs THEN it SHALL generate a coverage report in a standard format (e.g., XML, HTML).
5. WHEN the CI workflow completes THEN it SHALL publish the coverage report as an artifact.
